# pixi-task
As part of this task, I am working with PIXI.js for the first time in my career.
I really enjoyed working with PIXI.js and I would like to master this area better, ready to work hard.


To accomplish the task, I used many resources, such as pixi api docs and many tutorials from YouTube.
Maybe I used old docs or tutorials, so I'm not sure about the relevance of the code.
I wrote several functions for random generation of shapes and colors.
I tried to do gravity in several ways:
1) Through pixi particles
2) Through position.x + = 1, position.y + = 1

I used "Live Server" extension for Visual Studio Code
